# COMPLETE-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT-Czechoslovakia-Banking-Financial-Data-Analysis
The dataset covers statistics about Czechoslovakia Bank finances from 2018 to 2022. The dataset is divided into eight tables: clients, accounts, cards, loans, transactions, districts, disposition, and orders. This project aims to give the bank actionable information that will allow them to make informed decisions about their financial operations.
Data cleansing and exploratory data analysis are used to find trends and patterns in data. Data is cleaned using Excel and SQL and loaded from AWS to Snowflake utilizing continuous data ingestion.
Ad hoc Data Analysis: The Czechoslovakia Bank wants to assess its financial data to get insights and make sound judgments. The bank must recognize trends, patterns, and potential dangers in its financial operations. Based on their investigation, they also would like to look into the prospect of offering new financial products or services.
The analysis entails answering some of the critical questions identified by the bank. Understanding the demographic profile of the bank's clients and how it varies across different districts, identifying the most common types of accounts and cards used by the clients, analyzing the bank's expenses and loan portfolio, and exploring ways to improve customer service and satisfaction levels are among these questions.
Czechoslovakia Bank can use the findings of this investigation to better its financial operations and launch new financial goods or services.
